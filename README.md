# Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

The puzzles solved in this repository are part of the Advent calendar of 2021. Each day, a new puzzle with many parts, was unlocked, from December 1st to December 25th. 
The story that is being told along the problems, all the explanation of each problem and the solution of the problem, are saved in the folder of each day.
